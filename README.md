# NobelPrizesMongoRestApi by Julen Herrero

This project has been developed for the Data Access subject of the second course of Development of Multiplatform Applications in Uni Eibar. The main task is to develop a Rest Api that access a MongoDB database and to learn how a Rest Api can fit in a web application. In this case a JSON dataset was selected and loaded in a MongoDB database. That dataset collects all the nobel prizes that were given in the last century. 

The dataset has a particular structure, each prize is a JSONObject but at the same time this prizes have three main attributes; two Strings and an JSONObject Array. The main idea was to deal with a certain level of depth in our datasets avoiding picking plain datasets. The dataset selected for the project was picked from a collection of datasets located in GitHub. This is the link: https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets?tab=readme-ov-file
